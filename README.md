# Dotfiles
My Linux config files and .config folder 

Currently running [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) on my Thinkpad T460s

I am currently setting up and trying out BSPWM with polybar and dmenu but if I don't like that I'll go back to Sway

I might also check out NsCDE for the fun of it but I am not sure yet.
